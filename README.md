Metrics Integration for OkHttp
==============================

An [OkHttp][okhttp] HTTP client wrapper providing [Metrics][metrics]
instrumentation of connection pools, request durations and rates, and other
useful information.

Usage
-----

Metrics Integration for OkHttp provides `InstrumentedOkHttpClients`, a static
factory class for instrumenting OkHttp HTTP clients.

You can create an instrumented `OkHttpClient` by doing the following:

```java
MetricRegistry registry = ...;
OkHttpClient client = InstrumentedOkHttpClients.create(registry);
```

If you wish to provide your own `OkHttpClient` instance, you can do that as well:

```java
MetricRegistry registry = ...;
OkHttpClient rawClient = ...;
OkHttpClient client = InstrumentedOkHttpClients.create(registry, rawClient);
```

If you use more than one OkHttpClient instance in your application, you may
want to provide a custom name when instrumenting the clients in order to
properly distinguish them:

```java
MetricRegistry registry = ...;
OkHttpClient client = InstrumentedOkHttpClients.create(registry, "custom-name");

MetricRegistry registry = ...;
OkHttpClient rawClient = ...;
OkHttpClient client = InstrumentedOkHttpClients.create(registry, rawClient, "custom-name");
```

An instrumented OkHttp HTTP client provides the following metrics:

```
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-request-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-hit-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-network-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-current-size
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-max-size
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-size
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-write-success-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.cache-write-abort-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.connection-pool-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.connection-pool-count-http
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.connection-pool-count-multiplexed
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.network-requests-completed
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.network-requests-duration
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.network-requests-running
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.network-requests-submitted
```

If you provide a custom name for the instrumented client (i.e. `custom-name`),
the metrics will have the following format:

```
...
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.custom-name.cache-write-success-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.custom-name.cache-write-abort-count
okhttp3.OkHttpClient.custom-name.connection-pool-count
...
```

Download
--------

**Metrics Integration for OkHttp is currently under development.**  The API is
not stable and neither is the feature set.

Download [the latest jar][metrics-okhttp] or depend on Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.raskasa.metrics</groupId>
  <artifactId>metrics-okhttp</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.raskasa.metrics:metrics-okhttp:0.4.0'
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in
[Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][sonatype].
